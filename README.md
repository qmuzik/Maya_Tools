# Maya_Tools
Python Scripts that I have developed for Autodesk Maya to speed up work flows. 

Each Folder is a tool that can be added to your Maya Tool shelf. To use the tool, you must download the folder and save the script to your Maya shelf. 

Here is a description of what each Maya Tool does:

- Rig Skeleton Generator: Generates a Bipedal Skeleton in Maya with renamed bones inside a locator. Also allows the user to name the rig by propmting them with a GUI.
